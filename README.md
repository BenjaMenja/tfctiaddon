# TFC+: The Twilight Invasion Addon
This mod is an addon for the modpack TerraFirmaCraft+: The Twilight Invasion. It contains a few progression items necessary to complete the pack's quest line as well as uses for some "useless" items.<br><br>
While it may not have much of any use outside of the pack, this mod is free to use in any pack as long as the pack contains [TerraFirmaCraft+](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terrafirmacraftplus) and the [TFC+ Port of TerraMisc](https://github.com/nuckable/TerraMisc).
